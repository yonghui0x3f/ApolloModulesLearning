The perception module incorporates the capability of using multiple cameras, radars (front and rear) and LiDARs to recognize obstacles and fuse their individual tracks to obtain a final track list. The obstacle sub-module detects, classifies and tracks obstacles. This sub-module also predicts obstacle motion and position information (e.g., heading and velocity).
